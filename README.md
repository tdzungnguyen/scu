# Provenance in Social Computing
This tool is designed to support social computing unit (SCU) to take the advantages of the provenance data of Komadu.

## Description
Complex systems such as Collective Adaptive Systems that include a variety of resources, are increasingly being designed to include people in task-execution. Collectives, encapsulating human resources/services, represent one type of an appli- cation within which people with different type of skills can be engaged to solve one common problem or work on the same project. Mechanisms of managing social col- lectives are dependent on functional and non-functional parameters of members of social collectives. In this prototype, we implemented the functions to employ provenance in developing more efficient provisioning and management mechanisms in social computing.
